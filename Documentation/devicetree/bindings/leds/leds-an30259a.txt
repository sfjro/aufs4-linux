The AN30259A is a LED controller capable of driving three LEDs independently. It supports
constant current output and sloping current output modes. The chip is connected over I2C.

Required properties:
	- compatible: Must be "panasonic,an30259a".
	- reg: I2C slave address.
	- #address-cells: Must be 1.
	- #size-cells: Must be 0.

Each LED is represented as a sub-node of the panasonic,an30259a node.

Required sub-node properties:
	- reg: Pin that the LED is connected to. Must be 1, 2, or 3.

Optional sub-node properties:
	- label: see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
	- linux,default-trigger: see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt

Example:
led-controller@30 {
	compatible = "panasonic,an30259a";
	reg = <0x30>;
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;

	led@1 {
		reg = <1>;
		linux,default-trigger = "heartbeat";
		label = "red:indicator";
	};

	led@2 {
		reg = <2>;
		label = "green:indicator";
	};

	led@3 {
		reg = <3>;
		label = "blue:indicator";
	};
};
