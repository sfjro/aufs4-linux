Renesas R-Car LVDS Encoder
==========================

These DT bindings describe the LVDS encoder embedded in the Renesas R-Car
Gen2, R-Car Gen3 and RZ/G SoCs.

Required properties:

- compatible : Shall contain one of
  - "renesas,r8a7743-lvds" for R8A7743 (RZ/G1M) compatible LVDS encoders
  - "renesas,r8a7790-lvds" for R8A7790 (R-Car H2) compatible LVDS encoders
  - "renesas,r8a7791-lvds" for R8A7791 (R-Car M2-W) compatible LVDS encoders
  - "renesas,r8a7793-lvds" for R8A7793 (R-Car M2-N) compatible LVDS encoders
  - "renesas,r8a7795-lvds" for R8A7795 (R-Car H3) compatible LVDS encoders
  - "renesas,r8a7796-lvds" for R8A7796 (R-Car M3-W) compatible LVDS encoders
  - "renesas,r8a77970-lvds" for R8A77970 (R-Car V3M) compatible LVDS encoders
  - "renesas,r8a77980-lvds" for R8A77980 (R-Car V3H) compatible LVDS encoders
  - "renesas,r8a77990-lvds" for R8A77990 (R-Car E3) compatible LVDS encoders
  - "renesas,r8a77995-lvds" for R8A77995 (R-Car D3) compatible LVDS encoders

- reg: Base address and length for the memory-mapped registers
- clocks: A list of phandles + clock-specifier pairs, one for each entry in
  the clock-names property.
- clock-names: Name of the clocks. This property is model-dependent.
  - The functional clock, which mandatory for all models, shall be listed
    first, and shall be named "fck".
  - On R8A77990 and R8A77995, the LVDS encoder can use the EXTAL or
    DU_DOTCLKINx clocks. Those clocks are optional. When supplied they must be
    named "extal" and "dclkin.x" respectively, with "x" being the DU_DOTCLKIN
    numerical index.
  - When the clocks property only contains the functional clock, the
    clock-names property may be omitted.
- resets: A phandle + reset specifier for the module reset

Required nodes:

The LVDS encoder has two video ports. Their connections are modelled using the
OF graph bindings specified in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt.

- Video port 0 corresponds to the parallel RGB input
- Video port 1 corresponds to the LVDS output

Each port shall have a single endpoint.


Example:

	lvds0: lvds@feb90000 {
		compatible = "renesas,r8a7790-lvds";
		reg = <0 0xfeb90000 0 0x1c>;
		clocks = <&cpg CPG_MOD 726>;
		resets = <&cpg 726>;

		ports {
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;

			port@0 {
				reg = <0>;
				lvds0_in: endpoint {
					remote-endpoint = <&du_out_lvds0>;
				};
			};
			port@1 {
				reg = <1>;
				lvds0_out: endpoint {
				};
			};
		};
	};
