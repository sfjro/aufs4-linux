This driver supports both the I2C and SPI bus.

Required properties:
 - compatible: Should contain one of the following:
               "adi,adau1977"
               "adi,adau1978"
               "adi,adau1979"

 - AVDD-supply: analog power supply for the device, please consult
                Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt

Optional properties:
 - reset-gpio:  the reset pin for the chip, for more details consult
                Documentation/devicetree/bindings/gpio/gpio.txt

 - DVDD-supply: supply voltage for the digital core, please consult
                Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt

For required properties on SPI, please consult
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/spi/spi-bus.txt

Required properties on I2C:

 - reg:         The i2c address. Value depends on the state of ADDR0
                and ADDR1, as wired in hardware.

Examples:

	adau1977_spi: adau1977@0 {
		compatible = "adi,adau1977";
		spi-max-frequency = <600000>;

		AVDD-supply = <&regulator>;
		DVDD-supply = <&regulator_digital>;

		reset_gpio = <&gpio 10 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
	};

	adau1977_i2c: adau1977@11 {
		compatible = "adi,adau1977";
		reg = <0x11>;

		AVDD-supply = <&regulator>;
		DVDD-supply = <&regulator_digital>;

		reset_gpio = <&gpio 10 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
	};
