Amlogic Canvas
================================

A canvas is a collection of metadata that describes a pixel buffer.
Those metadata include: width, height, phyaddr, wrapping, block mode
and endianness.

Many IPs within Amlogic SoCs rely on canvas indexes to read/write pixel data
rather than use the phy addresses directly. For instance, this is the case for
the video decoders and the display.

Amlogic SoCs have 256 canvas.
