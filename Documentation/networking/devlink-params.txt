Devlink configuration parameters
================================
Following is the list of configuration parameters via devlink interface.
Each parameter can be generic or driver specific and are device level
parameters.

Note that the driver-specific files should contain the generic params
they support to, with supported config modes.

Each parameter can be set in different configuration modes:
	runtime		- set while driver is running, no reset required.
	driverinit	- applied while driver initializes, requires restart
			driver by devlink reload command.
	permanent	- written to device's non-volatile memory, hard reset
			required.

Following is the list of parameters:
====================================
enable_sriov		[DEVICE, GENERIC]
			Enable Single Root I/O Virtualisation (SRIOV) in
			the device.
			Type: Boolean

ignore_ari		[DEVICE, GENERIC]
			Ignore Alternative Routing-ID Interpretation (ARI)
			capability. If enabled, adapter will ignore ARI
			capability even when platforms has the support
			enabled and creates same number of partitions when
			platform does not support ARI.
			Type: Boolean

msix_vec_per_pf_max	[DEVICE, GENERIC]
			Provides the maximum number of MSIX interrupts that
			a device can create. Value is same across all
			physical functions (PFs) in the device.
			Type: u32

msix_vec_per_pf_min	[DEVICE, GENERIC]
			Provides the minimum number of MSIX interrupts required
			for the device initialization. Value is same across all
			physical functions (PFs) in the device.
			Type: u32
