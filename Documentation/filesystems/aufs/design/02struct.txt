Basic Aufs Internal Structure

Superblock/Inode/Dentry/File Objects
----------------------------------------------------------------------
As like an ordinary filesystem, aufs has its own
superblock/inode/dentry/file objects. All these objects have a
dynamically allocated array and store the same kind of pointers to the
lower filesystem, branch.
For example, when you build a union with one readwrite branch and one
readonly, mounted /au, /rw and /ro respectively.
- /au = /rw + /ro
- /ro/fileA exists but /rw/fileA

Aufs lookup operation finds /ro/fileA and gets dentry for that. These
pointers are stored in a aufs dentry. The array in aufs dentry will be,
- [0] = NULL (because /rw/fileA doesn't exist)
- [1] = /ro/fileA

This style of an array is essentially same to the aufs
superblock/inode/dentry/file objects.

Because aufs supports manipulating branches, ie. add/delete/change
branches dynamically, these objects has its own generation. When
branches are changed, the generation in aufs superblock is
incremented. And a generation in other object are compared when it is
accessed. When a generation in other objects are obsoleted, aufs
refreshes the internal array.


Superblock
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Additionally aufs superblock has some data for policies to select one
among multiple writable branches, XIB files, pseudo-links and kobject.
See below in detail.
About the policies which supports copy-down a directory, see
wbr_policy.txt too.


Branch and XINO(External Inode Number Translation Table)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Every branch has its own xino (external inode number translation table)
file. The xino file is created and unlinked by aufs internally. When two
members of a union exist on the same filesystem, they share the single
xino file.
The struct of a xino file is simple, just a sequence of aufs inode
numbers which is indexed by the lower inode number.
In the above sample, assume the inode number of /ro/fileA is i111 and
aufs assigns the inode number i999 for fileA. Then aufs writes 999 as
4(8) bytes at 111 * 4(8) bytes offset in the xino file.

When the inode numbers are not contiguous, the xino file will be sparse
which has a hole in it and doesn't consume as much disk space as it
might appear. If your branch filesystem consumes disk space for such
holes, then you should specify 'xino=' option at mounting aufs.

Aufs has a mount option to free the disk blocks for such holes in XINO
files on tmpfs or ramdisk. But it is not so effective actually. If you
meet a problem of disk shortage due to XINO files, then you should try
"tmpfs-ino.patch" (and "vfs-ino.patch" too) in aufs4-standalone.git.
The patch localizes the assignment inumbers per tmpfs-mount and avoid
the holes in XINO files.

Also a writable branch has three kinds of "whiteout bases". All these
are existed when the branch is joined to aufs, and their names are
whiteout-ed doubly, so that users will never see their names in aufs
hierarchy.
1. a regular file which will be hardlinked to all whiteouts.
2. a directory to store a pseudo-link.
3. a directory to store an "orphan"-ed file temporary.

1. Whiteout Base
   When you remove a file on a readonly branch, aufs handles it as a
   logical deletion and creates a whiteout on the upper writable branch
   as a hardlink of this file in order not to consume inode on the
   writable branch.
2. Pseudo-link Dir
   See below, Pseudo-link.
3. Step-Parent Dir
   When "fileC" exists on the lower readonly branch only and it is
   opened and removed with its parent dir, and then user writes
   something into it, then aufs copies-up fileC to this
   directory. Because there is no other dir to store fileC. After
   creating a file under this dir, the file is unlinked.

Because aufs supports manipulating branches, ie. add/delete/change
dynamically, a branch has its own id. When the branch order changes,
aufs finds the new index by searching the branch id.


XIB(external inode number bitmap)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Addition to the xino file per a branch, aufs has an external inode number
bitmap in a superblock object. It is also an internal file such like a
xino file.
It is a simple bitmap to mark whether the aufs inode number is in-use or
not.
To reduce the file I/O, aufs prepares a single memory page to cache xib.

As well as XINO files, aufs has a feature to truncate/refresh XIB to
reduce the number of consumed disk blocks for these files.
