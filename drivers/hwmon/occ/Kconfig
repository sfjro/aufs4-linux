config SENSORS_OCC_P8_I2C
	tristate "POWER8 OCC through I2C"
	depends on I2C
	select SENSORS_OCC
	help
	 This option enables support for monitoring sensors provided by the
	 On-Chip Controller (OCC) on a POWER8 processor. Communications with
	 the OCC are established through I2C bus.

	 This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module will be
	 called occ-p8-hwmon.

config SENSORS_OCC_P9_SBE
	tristate "POWER9 OCC through SBE"
	depends on FSI_OCC
	select SENSORS_OCC
	help
	 This option enables support for monitoring sensors provided by the
	 On-Chip Controller (OCC) on a POWER9 processor. Communications with
	 the OCC are established through SBE fifo on an FSI bus.

	 This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module will be
	 called occ-p9-hwmon.
