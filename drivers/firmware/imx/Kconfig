	  The System Controller Firmware (SCFW) is a low-level system function
	  which runs on a dedicated Cortex-M core to provide power, clock, and
	  resource management. It exists on some i.MX8 processors. e.g. i.MX8QM
	  (QM, QP), and i.MX8QX (QXP, DX).

	  This driver manages the IPC interface between host CPU and the
	  SCU firmware running on M4.
